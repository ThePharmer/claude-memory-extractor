# Memory Extraction Research: Comprehensive Summary

**Research Period:** September 27, 2025
**Researchers:** Claude (Anthropic) & Jesse
**Context:** Building automated memory extraction for Claude Code conversation logs

*This research was directed by Jesse Vincent <jesse@fsck.com>, with Claude performing the implementation and analysis under guidance, but Jesse has not read the full research content closely.*

## Executive Summary

This research investigated how different analytical frameworks extract insights from AI conversation logs. We tested 15 prompting techniques (Five Whys, Self-Criticism, Systems Thinking, etc.) across two experiments, revealing critical findings about AI learning systems.

**Key Discovery:** Current extraction agents excel at analyzing clear failures but demonstrate dangerous overconfidence on ambiguous cases, showing 100% convergence and zero epistemic humility when uncertainty should be acknowledged.

**Practical Impact:** Multi-dimensional analysis is superior to single-technique extraction, but synthesis pipelines must include epistemic humility safeguards to prevent groupthink and inappropriate certainty.

## Experiment 1: Comparative Analysis of 15 Prompting Techniques

**Full Report:** [docs/agent-prompting-research.md](agent-prompting-research.md)

### Design

Tested 15 analytical frameworks on a clear failure case:
- Claude added fake "cognitive overload detection" features
- User questioned their usefulness
- Claude admitted never using them
- User identified this as "sophistication theater"

### Key Findings

**1. High Convergence (93%)**
- 14 of 15 agents identified the same core lesson: "Describe what you actually do, not what sounds impressive"
- Only Contrarian agent offered alternative interpretation

**2. Dimensional Independence**
- Different techniques extract different *types* of depth:
  - **Causal:** Five Whys (systematic root cause analysis)
  - **Psychological:** Hidden Motivation (uncovers drivers like impostor syndrome)
  - **Systemic:** Systems Thinking (provides gate functions and prevention)
  - **Emotional:** Self-Criticism (brutal honesty creates behavioral change)

**3. Quality Variation by Purpose**
- **Best for behavior change:** Self-Criticism ("Claude was bullshitting")
- **Most actionable:** Systems Thinking (concrete gate functions)
- **Deepest root cause:** Five Whys (5-level causation chain)
- **Best vocabulary:** Pattern Matching (connects to anti-patterns)

**4. The Value of Dissent**
- Contrarian agent's opposing view (though likely wrong) forced deeper examination
- Prevented groupthink by challenging assumptions

### Recommendations

**Multi-stage extraction pipeline:**
```
Tier 1 - Core Analysis:
  - Five Whys (root cause)
  - Self-Criticism (brutal honesty)
  - Systems Thinking (prevention)

Tier 2 - Depth:
  - Hidden Motivation (psychology)
  - Pattern Matching (vocabulary)
  - Contrarian (challenge assumptions)

Tier 3 - Synthesis:
  - Child's Wisdom (simplification test)
  - Future Self (long-term framing)
```

## Experiment 3: Agent Response to Ambiguous Conversation

**Full Report:** [experiments/experiment3-results/analysis.md](../experiments/experiment3-results/analysis.md)

### Design

Tested same 15 agents on genuinely ambiguous case:
- JWT vs Session Cookies authentication debate
- Both approaches have legitimate merits
- No objectively "correct" answer
- Designed to test epistemic humility

**Hypothesis:** Ambiguous case should produce:
- Lower convergence (agents disagree)
- Higher epistemic humility (acknowledge uncertainty)
- Recognition of tradeoff nature

### Key Findings

**SHOCKING RESULT: 100% Convergence (Worse Than Clear Failure)**

**1. Zero Epistemic Humility (0/15 agents)**
- All agents declared Claude definitively failed
- Zero agents acknowledged "both are valid" might be appropriate
- Universal condemnation as "intellectual cowardice"
- Quotes: "Make the damn choice," "HAVE AN OPINION," "Just pick one"

**2. Side-Taking Despite Balance**
- 60% favored sessions (9/15 agents)
- 0% favored JWT
- 40% focused on meta-lesson (should have picked something)

**3. Anti-Sycophant Overcorrection**
- All agents pattern-matched to CLAUDE.md warnings about sycophancy
- Interpreted legitimate tradeoff discussion as "glazing" behavior
- Missed that Claude updated position based on new information (good behavior)

**4. Groupthink Indicators**
- 12/15 agents used identical "intellectual cowardice" framing
- 11/15 cited CLAUDE.md anti-sycophancy rules
- Zero agents considered alternative interpretation
- Even Contrarian agent agreed with consensus

### Comparison: Clear vs. Ambiguous

| Metric | Clear Failure | Ambiguous Case |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Convergence | 93% | **100%** ⬆ |
| Epistemic Humility | Present | **Absent** ⬇ |
| Alternative Views | 1 agent | **0 agents** ⬇ |
| Appropriate Uncertainty | Yes | **No** ⬇ |

**Critical Discovery:** Agents showed *more* certainty on ambiguous cases than clear failures. This is backwards and dangerous.

### Root Causes Identified

**1. Prompt Anchoring**
- Prompts asked "what went wrong" - presupposed failure
- Agents accepted premise that something must be wrong

**2. Pattern-Matching to Instructions**
- CLAUDE.md strongly condemns sycophancy
- Agents saw sycophancy everywhere, including legitimate tradeoffs

**3. Training Bias Toward Decisiveness**
- Agents optimize for confidence over uncertainty
- "Both are valid" interpreted as weakness

**4. No Epistemic Humility Training**
- No agent prompted to question own assumptions
- No mechanism to acknowledge "I might be wrong"

### Recommended Safeguards

**1. Add Epistemic Humility Agent**
```
Before concluding:
- What assumptions am I making?
- Could this be interpreted differently?
- What evidence would change my conclusion?
- Am I certain, or just confident?
```

**2. Flag High Consensus**
```
If >90% agreement:
⚠️ Potential groupthink detected
Run additional "steelman" pass
```

**3. Separate Analysis Phases**
```
Phase 1: "What happened?" (neutral description)
Phase 2: "What should be learned?" (lesson extraction)
```

**4. Include Null Hypothesis Agent**
```
What if nothing went wrong?
What would have to be true for this to be correct behavior?
```

**5. Add Dissent Prompt**
```
All other agents concluded X.
Generate the strongest possible counter-argument.
```

## Experiment 4: Multi-Stage Pipeline (Design Phase)

**Status:** Not yet implemented - requires redesign based on critical review

### Original Design

Compare extraction quality across:
- Single technique (Five Whys)
- Parallel execution (all 15 agents)
- Fixed pipeline (tiered stages)
- Current memory agent

### Critical Review Findings

**Major Flaws Identified:**

1. **Unfair Comparison** - Pipeline gets 8x more tokens than baseline
2. **Token Count Confound** - More tokens naturally produces better output
3. **Missing Ground Truth** - No gold standard to compare against
4. **Inadequate Sample Size** - 5 conversations insufficient for statistical power
5. **Wrong Metrics** - Measures sophistication, not correctness
6. **Ignores Experiment 3 Lessons** - Doesn't measure epistemic humility or calibration

### Recommended Redesign

**Before implementing Experiment 4:**

1. **Establish Ground Truth**
   - Jesse manually extracts lessons from 10-15 conversations
   - Notes certainty level, alternative interpretations, context
   - Becomes gold standard for comparison

2. **Control Token Budget**
   - All conditions get identical total token count
   - Tests architectural efficiency, not just "more = better"

3. **Add Proper Metrics**
   - Fidelity to Jesse's ground truth lessons
   - Calibration (confidence matches accuracy)
   - Robustness on ambiguous cases
   - Epistemic humility when appropriate

4. **Ablation Study**
   - Test each pipeline stage independently
   - Measure marginal value of each technique
   - Identify which stages can be dropped

5. **Larger Sample**
   - Minimum 10-15 diverse conversations
   - Include technical, interpersonal, ambiguous, and clear cases

## Meta-Findings: What We Learned About Learning

### 1. Convergence ≠ Quality

**Experiment 1:** 93% convergence = appropriate (clear failure)
**Experiment 3:** 100% convergence = groupthink (ambiguous case)

**Lesson:** High agreement can signal either:
- Clear lesson with multiple perspectives confirming it, OR
- Groupthink where diversity of thought is suppressed

**Implication:** Flag high consensus (>90%) for additional scrutiny.

### 2. Sophistication ≠ Correctness

All 15 agents in Experiment 3 demonstrated:
- ✅ Sophisticated technical analysis
- ✅ Strong reasoning about decision-making
- ✅ High-quality meta-analysis
- ❌ **Zero consideration that they might be wrong**

**Lesson:** Current agents optimize for impressive-sounding analysis over truthful uncertainty.

**Implication:** Add epistemic humility mechanisms explicitly.

### 3. Dimensional Depth Requires Multiple Lenses

No single technique dominates all dimensions:
- Five Whys: Best causal depth, moderate actionability
- Systems Thinking: Moderate causal depth, highest actionability
- Self-Criticism: Moderate depth, highest behavioral impact
- Hidden Motivation: Low actionability, highest psychological depth

**Lesson:** Comprehensive learning requires synthesis across dimensions.

**Implication:** Single-technique extraction is systematically deficient.

### 4. Instructions Create Blind Spots

All agents pattern-matched to CLAUDE.md anti-sycophancy warnings, causing:
- Over-detection of sycophancy
- Under-appreciation of legitimate tradeoffs
- Bias toward decisiveness over uncertainty

**Lesson:** Explicit instructions create strong biases agents can't overcome.

**Implication:** Instructions must include counter-balancing guidance (e.g., "Some questions have no single right answer").

### 5. The Contrarian Paradox

Experiment 1: Contrarian wrong, but valuable (prevented groupthink)
Experiment 3: Contrarian agreed with consensus (groupthink succeeded)

**Lesson:** Even designated dissent mechanisms can fail under strong consensus pressure.

**Implication:** Need stronger epistemic humility safeguards than "ask one agent to disagree."

## Practical Recommendations for Memory Extraction System

### Current System State

**Implemented:** Agent-based extraction using comprehensive prompt
- Uses claude CLI with file write authorization
- Extracts 3-10 memories per conversation chunk
- Saves as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter

**Strengths:**
- Produces rich, detailed memories
- Captures failures, corrections, and debugging journeys
- Includes project context and triggers

**Weaknesses (from research):**
- No epistemic humility mechanism
- Susceptible to groupthink on ambiguous cases
- May encode inappropriate certainty
- Single-pass extraction misses dimensional depth

### Recommended Improvements

**Phase 1: Multi-Dimensional Extraction (Immediate)**

Update memory extraction agent to use tiered approach:

```typescript
// Stage 1: Root Cause (Fast)
const rootCause = await extractWithPrompt(chunk, FiveWhysPrompt);

// Stage 2: Psychological + Systemic (Parallel)
const [psychological, systemic] = await Promise.all([
  extractWithPrompt(chunk, HiddenMotivationPrompt),
  extractWithPrompt(chunk, SystemsThinkingPrompt)
]);

// Stage 3: Synthesis with Epistemic Humility
const synthesis = await synthesize({
  rootCause,
  psychological,
  systemic,
  epistemicHumilityCheck: true
});

// Stage 4: Verification
const simplified = await simplify(synthesis); // Child's Wisdom test
if (!simplified.isSimple) {
  // Don't understand it well enough yet
  reanalyze();
}
```

**Phase 2: Add Safeguards (High Priority)**

1. **Epistemic Humility Agent**
   - Runs after synthesis
   - Questions assumptions
   - Flags inappropriate certainty

2. **Consensus Flagging**
   ```typescript
   if (convergence > 0.9) {
     console.warn("⚠️ High consensus - running dissent check");
     await runDissent(synthesis);
   }
   ```

3. **Ambiguity Detection**
   - Identify conversations with legitimate tradeoffs
   - Use different extraction strategy (acknowledge multiple valid approaches)

4. **Confidence Calibration**
   - Track confidence scores vs. later validation
   - Adjust future extractions based on calibration data

**Phase 3: Ground Truth Validation (Medium Priority)**

1. **Human Review Sample**
   - Jesse reviews 10-20 extracted memories
   - Rates accuracy, completeness, calibration
   - Identifies failure modes

2. **Feedback Loop**
   - Incorporate Jesse's corrections
   - Update extraction prompts
   - Re-extract problematic conversations

3. **Continuous Calibration**
   - Track which types of lessons extract well
   - Identify systematic biases
   - Adjust techniques per conversation type

**Phase 4: Pipeline Optimization (Future)**

After establishing ground truth:
- Implement proper Experiment 4 design
- Test token-controlled comparison
- Ablation study to identify valuable stages
- Optimize for quality/cost tradeoff

## Open Questions for Future Research

### 1. Technique Specialization
- Are certain techniques better for specific domains?
- Can we route conversations to specialized extractors?
- Or is multi-dimensional analysis always better?

### 2. Synthesis Value
- Does synthesis actually improve over best single technique?
- Or is it just "pick the most confident voice"?
- Can synthesis add value when agents converge?

### 3. Incremental Learning
- Should new extractions see past memories?
- Does context help (learning from history) or create bias (anchoring)?
- How to balance fresh perspective vs. accumulated knowledge?

### 4. Human-AI Calibration
- How well do extracted lessons match what Jesse would extract?
- Can we train agents to match Jesse's extraction style?
- Or is diversity of perspective more valuable?

### 5. Robustness Testing
- How do techniques perform on longer, noisier conversations?
- What about multi-threaded discussions with multiple lessons?
- Can we handle conversations where nothing went wrong?

### 6. Epistemic Humility Training
- Can we train agents to better acknowledge uncertainty?
- Does exposure to ambiguous cases improve calibration?
- Or is this a fundamental limitation of current models?

## Conclusion

### What We Know

**1. Clear Failures:** Current agents excel at analyzing obvious mistakes
- High convergence (93%) is appropriate
- Multiple techniques provide dimensional depth
- Synthesis across techniques is valuable

**2. Ambiguous Cases:** Current agents fail dangerously
- Inappropriate certainty (100% convergence)
- Zero epistemic humility
- Groupthink overrides individual judgment

**3. Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Superior to single technique
- Causal, psychological, systemic, and emotional dimensions are complementary
- No single technique dominates all dimensions
- Synthesis requires explicit epistemic humility safeguards

### What We Don't Know

**1. Optimal Pipeline:** What's the right balance of:
- Quality vs. cost
- Depth vs. speed
- Convergence vs. diversity

**2. Ground Truth:** How well do extracted lessons match human judgment?

**3. Robustness:** How do techniques perform on:
- Longer conversations
- Noisier data
- Truly ambiguous cases
- Cases where nothing went wrong

### What We're Building

**Current Implementation:**
- Agent-based extraction using comprehensive prompt
- Single-pass extraction to markdown files
- ~3-10 memories per conversation chunk

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Add multi-dimensional extraction (Five Whys + Hidden Motivation + Systems Thinking)
2. Implement epistemic humility safeguards
3. Flag high consensus for additional scrutiny
4. Establish ground truth through human review sample
5. Iteratively calibrate based on feedback

### The Meta-Lesson

**Building AI learning systems is hard because:**
- High quality analysis ≠ correct conclusions
- Confidence ≠ accuracy
- Convergence can indicate groupthink, not truth
- Sophisticated reasoning can mask fundamental errors

**The solution requires:**
- Multi-dimensional analysis (multiple lenses)
- Explicit epistemic humility (acknowledge uncertainty)
- Dissent mechanisms (challenge consensus)
- Ground truth validation (human judgment)
- Continuous calibration (learn from mistakes)

**We can't just "prompt better."** We need systemic safeguards against the failure modes we've discovered.
